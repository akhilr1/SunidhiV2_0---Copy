                                visits to the Sites. A "cookie" is a small amount of data that is sent to User’s browser
                                and stored on User’s device. If User does not deactivate or erase the cookie, each time

                                visit to the Platform and in turn BillionLives may have knowledge of User visit and the
                                pattern of User’s usage. </p>
                            <p>Generally, BillionLives use cookies to identify User and enable BillionLives to i) access

                                it; ii) gather statistical information about usage by Users; iii) research visiting
                                patterns and help target advertisements based on User interests; iv) assist
                                BillionLives’ partners to track User visits to the Platform and process orders; and v)
                                track progress and participation on the Platform.

                                User can determine if and how a cookie will be accepted by configuring the browser which
                                is installed in User’s device. If User choose, User can change those configurations. If
                                User reject all cookies by choosing the cookie-disabling function, User may be required
                                to re-enter information on the Platform more often and certain features of the Platform
